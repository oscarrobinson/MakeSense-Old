							<p>
								This formal set of requirements was drawn up to meet the needs of our client, Steve Hailes.  These requirements were essential throughout the project to determine in what order work packages were assigned.  As the requirements were prioritised in the MoSCoW style, we implemented the Must Have requirements first.  All the Must Have requirements for the web application were implemented and most of the Must Have requirements for the hardware were implemented.  Some Should Have requirements for the web application were also successfully implemented.
							</p>
							<p>
								The list of requirements is beyond the scope of what we hoped to achieve during the project and therefore gives guidelines for what future development should aim to implement into the system.

							<h1>Web Application</h1>
							<h2>Current Web App Implementation</h2>
							
							<p><i>For architectural diagrams of the web app, click the '<b>Archiectural Diagrams</b>' tab above</i></p>
							<br>
							
							<p>
								The current implementation of the web application was designed with the Model View Controller design pattern in mind.  The web app was built in an agile way.  A set of requirements was drawn up and these were implemented in work packages designated to members of the team.
							</p>
							<p>
								As no members of the team had ever created a web application before, we quickly found our initial research and plans for the applicationâ€™s development had been slightly misguided.  Hence the current implementation of the web application does not have an entirely satisfactory architecture, despite satisfying all the must have and some of the should have requirements of the system.  In the current design, pages generate content by calling scripts written in PHP, these scripts generate the required HTML dynamically by creating an instance of the DataManager class.  The DataManager class has access to the database and fetches the information required by the UI depending on which method in the DataManager is called.  This data is then returned to the PHP script which generates the HTML which is rendered by the web page.
							</p>
							<p>
								This structure does roughly align with the principles of the MVC design pattern in that there is a Model  in the system (the DataManager class coupled with the database) and a view (the generated HTML pages which the user interacts with).   However, the Controller is split between several parts of JavaScript code which call different PHP scripts to generate UI elements.  This is not a good design as the number of different scripts required will expand as more features are added to the web application.  It is clear that the current implementation of the system, although functional, will not be easy for developers to work with in the future.  To improve the applicationâ€™s extensibility and efficiency, it will be important to create a dedicated Controller class for the system to use, the details of how this could be implemented are discussed in the next section.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class='container'>
							<h2>Future Web App Implementation</h2>
							<p>
								To improve the web applicationâ€™s design, all generation of user interface elements should be moved into JavaScript code, this  would allow for better performance and also allow for easier error generation and progress reports to provide more information to the user when the application is slow or errors in retrieving information from the database occur.
							</p>
							<p>
								When the user makes a request for some data, the JavaScript would then send a POST request to a PHP controller class.  This class would handle all data requests from the user.  Given a request, the script would use its instance of the DataManager class to fetch the required data from the database.  The data would then be given as the result of the request back to the JavaScript code where any required UI elements could be generated.  If the data was not returned as expected, a useful error message could instead be displayed to the user.
							</p>
							<p>	
								This structure is much better aligned with the MVC design pattern and would give the web application much improved performance.  The introduction of a dedicated Controller class in PHP would mean new features would be much quicker to implement as any new UI code could be written in the new page then any dynamic content could be easily added by adding additional methods to the Controller class.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class = 'container'>
							<h1>Hardware</h1>
								<h2>Stamps</h2>
									<p>The networking code to send sensor data between the stamps uses ContikiOS.  ContikiOS acts as a facade to the complicated networking code.  Our code implements the â€˜collectâ€™ networking mechanism.  The <a href='https://github.com/andrewgrex/MethHardware/blob/master/examples/OrisenStamp/collectGateway.c'>collectGateway.c</a> code designates the gateway stamp as the collect node, therefore all sensor data sent from nodes running the <a href='https://github.com/andrewgrex/MethHardware/blob/master/examples/OrisenStamp/collectSensor.c'>collectSensor.c</a> code is automatically sent to the gateway node.  The data can hop over other sensor nodes if the gateway node is not in range.  As long as a sensor nodes is in range of a node which has a path to the gateway, data from that node will also reach the gateway.  This makes the system very robust and means networks can be spread out over a large buildings very easily.</p>
								<h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
									<p>The raspberry pi runs the <a href='https://github.com/andrewgrex/MethHardware/blob/master/piGateway.py'>piGateway.py</a> code.  This code reads the Piâ€™s GPIO serial pins to get the data the collect stamp is receiving.  This data is then fed into the database.  Currently this is done with direct database access.  However, this code could now be refactored to use the MakeSenseDB API, avoiding the need for direct database access from the Pi and therefore avoiding the security risks this involves.</p>
						</div>
						<div class = 'container'>
							<h1>APIs</h1>
								<h2>MakeSenseDB API</h2>
									<p>The <a href='https://github.com/scarrobin/MakeSense-Python/blob/master/makesensepy.py'>makesensepy.py</a> module for python allows users to add data from their own sensor networks to the MakeSense system.  The methods act as an Adaptor, hiding the formatting and network request code so the user can simply add data to the system using intuitive methods such as addSensor().</p>
								<h2>Arduino API</h2>
									<p>Our Arduino API allows users to create their own sensor node hardware to attach a stamp to.  The code acts as an Adaptor to the code to properly format the data to be sent by the stamp so the user can send their code in an intuitive way.</p>

								<h1>Project Management and Work Packages</h1>
								<p>
									The project was primarily managed using an agile approach in regards to work packages and progress. The team would meet around 2/3 times per week to show progress, set milestones and to make decisions on the long term plans for the project. The table below shows the dates of the meetings held by the team (with or without our supervisor). 
								</p>
								<p>
									Work packages were designed with emphasis placed on the priority of each task to eventually create a minimum viable product. The key packages delivered this term have been: 
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										conversion to a mesh network system for the sensor nodes <b>[Oscar]</b>
									</li>
									<li>
										migration from a Laptop-based gateway to a Raspberry Pi <b>[Oscar and Jay]</b>
									</li>
									<li>
										work on the web application to support user accounts paired with personal data networks <b>[Andrew]</b>
									</li>
									<li>
										sensor ontology work <b>[Oscar]</b>
									</li>
									<li>
										database design and implementation <b>[Oscar and Andrew]</b>
									</li>
									<li>
										API construction <b>[Oscar and Jay]</b>
									</li>
								</ol>	
								<p>
									Having completed these key work packages, we believe we have created our minimum viable product.
